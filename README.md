# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient clinical data.  
It demonstrates skills in **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling** using Python.

## 🚀 Features
- Input patient data (age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)
- Preprocess and clean the dataset
- Train and evaluate machine learning models
- Predict the likelihood of heart disease
- Simple web interface (Next.js + API) to interact with the model

---

## 📊 Dataset
The model was trained using a publicly available dataset from **Kaggle**:  
👉 [Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)  

**Key features include:**
- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest Pain Type  
- Resting Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Maximum Heart Rate  
- Exercise Induced Angina  
- ST Depression & more

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)  
- **Next.js** (frontend form & API integration)  
- **Flask / FastAPI** (backend prediction service)  
- **Docker** (optional containerization)

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters patient clinical data in the web form.  
2. Data is sent to the backend API.  
3. Machine learning model processes the input and predicts heart disease likelihood.  
4. Prediction result is displayed in the UI.
